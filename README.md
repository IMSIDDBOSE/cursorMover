To anyone who doesn't want their system to idle out and lock their screen, this is just a fun project for you!

  Make sure you have the **pyautogui** library installed before running this script. 
  You can install it by running: **pip install pyautogui** / **pip3 install pyautogui** in your command line or terminal.

  Post installing _pyautogui_, Go to the directory where you have placed the script and type the following command and hit Return/Enter:
